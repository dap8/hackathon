# Digi.me SDK for Android

The Digi.me SDK for Android is a multi-module library that allows seamless authentication with Consent Access service, making content requests and core decryption services. For details on the API and general CA architecture, visit [Dev Support Docs](http://devsupport.digi.me/start.html).
